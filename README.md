# Kubernetes Debugging

This is a general repository I will be storing kubernetes debugging commands/tools/scripts in.  It will build up over time.

## High Level Debugging

See k8s-high-level-debugging for commands that help you understand the state of your cluster at large.  Look for
how many pods are in various statuses, which nodes contain the most of a given pod status, which nodes run the most
and least work, and which namespaces are largest in your cluster.
